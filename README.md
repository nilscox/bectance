This is a pet project aiming at simplifying our daily life by providing food stock management, product expiry alerts, groceries list, recipes catalog, and other useful stuff.

Background: We (my wife and I) currently use trello and notion for this, and it ~sucks~ can be improved. As we spend a significant amount of our time buying and preparing food, we thought it would be cool to make some project to help us with that. And of course, it gives us another reason to write code! ðŸ¤“
